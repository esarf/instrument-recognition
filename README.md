# Instrument recognition by audio feature extraction and transformation using Virtual Audio SVMs

In this project, we propose an implementation of the following paper by Lardeur et al.: *Incorporating prior knowledge on the digital media creation process into audio classifiers* (https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/essid/papers/ML_ICASSP-09.pdf).

## Data

We worked on the famous IRMAS Dataset (https://zenodo.org/record/1290750#.YJBIHi0itbV). The extracted features are available in the file `data.csv`.
## Notebook 

The notebook might not display correctly because the file is too large. You can use Jupyter nbviewer : https://nbviewer.jupyter.org.

## Report

The file `Report.pdf` contains our report with the theoretical foundations of the models used, as well as implementation results and discussion.
